<h2> Introduction </h2>
Human DNA is about 99.5% identical from person to person. However, there are small differences that make each person unique. These differences are called variants. And these variants are linked to certain health conditions.<br>
Variants are of two types, Coding and Non-coding.Â <br>
Coding DNA: The DNA which encodes the proteins are called coding DNA Non Coding DNA: DNA which do not encode proteins are called Non-coding DNA.<br>
In order to understand the genetic basis of disease, we need to understand the impact of variants across the genome.
