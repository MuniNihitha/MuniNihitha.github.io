<h2> <b> Introduction </b> </h2>
Human DNA is about 99.5% identical from person to person. However, there are small differences that make each person unique. These differences are called variants. And these variants are linked to certain health conditions.
<p>
Variants are of two types, Coding and Non-coding.Â 
<p>
<b>Coding DNA:</b> The DNA which encodes the proteins are called coding DNA.
  </p><p>
<b>Non Coding DNA:</b> DNA which do not encode proteins are called Non-coding DNA.</p>
<p>
In order to understand the genetic basis of disease, we need to understand the impact of variants across the genome.</p>
<p>
<h2><b>Why Non Coding Variants?</b></h2></p>
<p>
 Only about 1 percent of DNA is made up of protein-coding genes; the other 99 percent is non coding. Scientists once thought non coding DNA was "junk," with no known purpose. However, it is becoming clear that at least some of it is integral to the function of cells, particularly the control of gene activity and majority of the diseases are caused by these non-coding variants.
