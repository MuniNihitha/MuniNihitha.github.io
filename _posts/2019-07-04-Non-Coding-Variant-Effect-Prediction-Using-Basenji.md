<h2> <b> Introduction </b> </h2>
Human DNA is about 99.5% identical from person to person. However, there are small differences that make each person unique. These differences are called variants. And these variants are linked to certain health conditions.
<p>
Variants are of two types, Coding and Non-coding.Â 
<p>
<b>Coding DNA:</b> The DNA which encodes the proteins are called coding DNA.
  </p><p>
<b>Non Coding DNA:</b> DNA which do not encode proteins are called Non-coding DNA.</p>
<p>
In order to understand the genetic basis of disease, we need to understand the impact of variants across the genome.</p>
